    <p>There are few things better than Chicken Alfredo Pasta, and what makes it even better, is that it's all prepared in a single skillet and is a breeze to make. (And it really tastes like it's from a restaurant!)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large boneless/skinless chicken breast, (or 2 small.) About ¾-1 lb.</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons salted butter, high quality</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups half and half, (half cream/half milk)</li>
        <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>½ cup Romano cheese, grated</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>¾ lb. Fettuccine</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Pro Tip</em></strong>: Reserve 1 cup of pasta water after the pasta is done cooking. This will give you full control over the consistency of the sauce at the end. A little splash can help if it becomes too thick. It's also helpful to have on hand if you are reheating leftovers.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure out ingredients</strong> before beginning, then <strong>begin heating a pot of salted water</strong> for the pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the chicken in half lengthwise</strong> to create 2-3 thinner slices. <strong>Pat dry and season each side with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat and add the chicken</strong>. Sear on each side for about 4-5 minutes, until a golden crust has developed. Set aside and let it rest for 10 minutes, then <strong>cut into strips</strong>. Leave most of the chicken remnants (“fond”) in the pan, but wipe away any black spots if there are any.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the pasta</strong> according to package instructions, then drain. Prepare the sauce while the pasta boils.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the butter</strong> in in the same skillet that you used to cook the chicken over medium heat. <strong>Add the garlic</strong> and cook for one minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk in the flour</strong> and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the half and half</strong> in small splashes, stirring continuously.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring to a gentle bubble, then reduce heat to low. Let it simmer while the pasta finishes cooking</strong>. The water from the liquid will slowly evaporate which will make the sauce thicker. Stir it occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Slowly stir the grated cheese into the sauce</strong>. (*Be sure to do this over <strong><em>low</em></strong> heat.*) Taste and <strong>season with salt/pepper</strong> if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the drained pasta and toss</strong> until well incorporated. The pasta will absorb the sauce and it will continue to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken back</strong> and toss. Allow it to heat back through, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish with chopped parsley</strong> and serve!</li>
    </ol>
