    <p>One key to these cookies is genuinely, as annoying as it's going to soundâ€¦ but trusting the recipe. If you want the cookies that are in the photos, you want to STICK TO THE RECIPE. Stick to the recipe for at least the first time, and then you can try altering it to different sugars and so on!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>125 g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>100 g light brown sugar</li>
        <li>75 g white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla (optional!)</li>
        <li>300 g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 + 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>300 g chocolate chips (150g dark, 150g milk)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your butter and sugars to a bowl and beat until creamy - I use my stand mixer with the beater attachment!</li>
        <li>Add in your egg, and beat again. If using vanilla, add it in now!</li>
        <li>Add in the plain flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt and beat until a cookie dough is formed!</li>
        <li>Add in your chocolate chips and beat till they're distributed well!</li>
        <li>Weigh your cookies out into eight cookie dough balls - they're about 120g each!</li>
        <li>Once they're rolled into balls, put your cookie dough in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, or in the fridge for an hour or so!</li>
        <li>Whilst the cookie dough is chilling, preheat your oven to 180C Fan, or 200C regular! If your oven runs hot, go for 160C-170c.</li>
        <li>Take your cookies out of the freezer/fridge and put onto a lined baking tray. I put four cookies per tray!</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies in the oven for 12-14 minutes. I don't personally flatten the cookies, as they flatten enough during baking - however, if you like flat cookies, flatten them a bit before baking.</li>
        <li>Once baked, leave them to cool on the tray for at least 30 minutes, as they will continue to bake whilst cooling!</li>
    </ol>
